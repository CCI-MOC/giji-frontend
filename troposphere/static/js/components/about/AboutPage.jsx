This MOC marketplace GUI serves to be a simpler tool streamlining the cloud experience. It can be used by itself or alongside Horizon. Developing a new GUI from scratch can be both time-consuming and challenging. A collaboration with the Cyverseâ€™s Atmosphere/Troposphere project has helped accelerate the development of the MOC GUI."}
